just a color noise patch for AudioContext, will only work in browser environments that have support for AudioContext.
The methods createWhiteNoise, createBrownNoise, and createPinkNoise are added to the global AudioContext object when required. The module export actually returns the result of "new AudioContext;" on import just because it feels more natural that way, the AudioContext is patched globally so you don't have to use it that way if you don't want.
