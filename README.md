just a color noise patch for AudioContext, will only work in browser environments that have support for AudioContext.
The methods createWhiteNoise, createBrownNoise, and createPinkNoise are added to the global AudioContext object. The import returns the AudioContext object but you don't actually have to do more than require('color-noise') to modify the prototype of AudioContext.
