just a color noise patch for AudioContext, will only work in browser environments that have support for AudioContext.
The methods createWhiteNoise, createBrownNoise, and createPinkNoise are added to AudioContext when you run the required function.
the function will also return the new AudioContext as I think it's more idiomatic to return from a module ';
